    <h1>BUTTERY PASTRY DOUGH</h1>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs, plus 1 egg for glazing</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 cup salted butter, cold, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and a pinch of the sugar.</strong> Let sit for a few minutes until the yeast has started to bloom.</li>
        <li><strong>Meanwhile, add the flour, pieces of butter, and salt to a food processor.</strong> Pulse until the pieces of butter are roughly the size of beans.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the rest of the sugar, 2 eggs, and heavy cream to the bowl with the yeast,</strong> storring vigorously to combine. Gradually add in the flour and butter mixture, working until the mixture just comes together. Divide in half, press the dough into two round discs, wrap in plastic, and chill for at least 6 hours. The chilled dough will keep for several days if wrapped well.</li>
        <li><strong>Working with one chilled disc of dough at a time,</strong> Transfer to a lightly floured surface, dusting both sides od the dough with extra flour as needed. Using a rolling pin, beat and roll the dough into a long, flat rectangle. Fold both edges over like a letter, making three layers of dough. Roll flat, then rotate the dough and repeat the folding and rolling. Rewrap and return to the fridge until needed. Dough can be frozen for up to 2 months.</li>
